### KSD

### Description
This package is an adaptation of Kernelized Stein Discrepancy, a discrepancy statistic for measuring differences between two probability distributions based on combination of Stein's method and reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory. It is based on "A Kernelized Stein Discrepancy for Goodness-of-fit Tests and Model Evaluation" by Liu, Lee, and Jordan, available at <http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03253>.
